## How it's made:
**Tech Used** HTML and CSS
I built this Yelp prototype with HTML, CSS and used media queries to make it responsive. I spent a fair amount of time trying to make the prototype closely match the Yelp site by using similar colors.

## Lesson Learned
I had a lot of fun with this project. This was a moment for me to actually see my CSS skills develop. It was a bit challenging at first to work with media queries but this project helped me better understand how they work.
